- Local user accounts with bcrypt password hashing (SHA-256 pre-hash for >72 byte passwords)
- LDAP/Active Directory authentication with configurable filters, attribute mappings, and StartTLS
- OIDC/OAuth2 flow with configurable scopes, groups claim, and automatic user provisioning
- Proxy header authentication (Authelia/Authentik) with trusted proxy IP validation
- API key authentication with bcrypt-hashed keys, prefix lookup, expiration, and usage tracking
- Configurable session duration with HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies
- Session fixation prevention — existing sessions invalidated on new login
- First-time setup wizard for guided auth provider configuration

### DashGate

- Category-based app organization with YAML or UI-based configuration
- Group-based access control — users only see apps their groups permit
- Real-time health status indicators (online/offline/unknown) via background checks
- Service dependency graph with forward and reverse dependency tracking
- Per-user theme preferences (light/dark mode, accent colors)
- Progressive Web App with service worker, offline page, and install support
- Self-hosted Inter font family (no external CDN)

### Admin Panel

- App catalog CRUD — add, edit, delete apps and categories from the UI
- Custom icon upload with file type validation and SVG XSS scanning
- Local user management — create, update, delete users and reset passwords
- API key management with scoped permissions and optional expiration
- System configuration editor for auth, session, and proxy settings
- LLDAP directory browsing (read-only users and groups)
- Audit logging for all admin actions with IP tracking
- Backup and restore of system configuration and user data
- Discovered app override management (rename, re-icon, re-categorize, hide/show)

### App Discovery

- Docker container discovery via socket API with label-based metadata
- Traefik router discovery via API with basic auth support
- Nginx configuration file parsing for server blocks
- Nginx Proxy Manager proxy host discovery via API
- Caddy reverse proxy route discovery via admin API
- Per-source enable/disable, manual refresh, and connection testing
- Override system for customizing discovered app display and access

### Security

- Content Security Policy with per-request nonces for inline scripts
- CSRF protection via double-submit cookie with constant-time comparison
- Per-IP rate limiting on login endpoints (configurable limit and window)
- Security headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest for sensitive config values (passwords, secrets)
- Encryption key management via environment variable or auto-generation
- Request body size limiting (1 MB) to prevent DoS
- URL scheme validation to block javascript: XSS in app URLs
- Directory listing disabled on static file server
- Open redirect prevention on login/OIDC callbacks
- Non-root Docker container (uid 1000)

### Infrastructure

- Embedded SQLite database with WAL mode, automatic schema creation, and migrations
- Graceful shutdown — all background goroutines (health checker, session cleanup, rate limiter) stop cleanly via context cancellation
- Panic recovery in all background goroutines
- Multi-stage Docker build with Alpine runtime (~9.5 MB image)
- Docker Compose configuration with volume mounts
- Background health checker with concurrent checks (semaphore-limited to 20)
- Periodic session cleanup (hourly)
- Configuration hierarchy: environment variables > database > YAML > defaults
- Version tracking via build-time ldflags injection
- End-to-end test suite (Playwright) covering auth, DashGate dashboard, admin, setup, and settings
- Encryption unit tests
- Windows build scripts (batch and PowerShell) with MSYS2/MinGW CGO support
